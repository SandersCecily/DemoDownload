## Explaination

This was created for the sole purpose of getting my feet wet with git and coming to understand the functionalities I would be using later on for continued projects. There's not much in the way of substance or functionality, but, feel free to check out more recent code to know my current skill levels. This is just a reminder for me how far I've come.
